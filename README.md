## 📌 Goals
- Understand car sales distribution across models, months, and regions in Finland.
- Identify key performance metrics (revenue, units sold, average price).
- Segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model.
- Analyze customer retention using cohort analysis.
- Detect potential churned customers.
- Forecast future revenue with SQL trend modeling.
- Create a professional Power BI dashboard for stakeholders.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL)
- **Power BI**
- **Excel** (data cleaning)
- **GitHub** (version control)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Most sold models: Skoda Octavia and Fabia dominated market share.
- Revenue peaked in Q3, with significant growth in Helsinki region.
- 20% of customers contributed to over 70% of total revenue (Pareto Rule).
- Churn rate increased in the last quarter of 2023.
- Forecast showed a stable growth trend for early 2024.

## 📈 Advanced Analytics Included
- 🔁 **RFM Analysis**: Prioritized customer segments by behavior.
- 📉 **Churn Analysis**: Identified drop-off patterns by frequency & recency.
- 🧩 **Cohort Analysis**: Monitored customer engagement over time.
- 🔮 **Revenue Forecasting**: SQL-based linear trend projections.

2. Open the Power BI file to interact with the dashboard.
3. Modify or expand the data model if you'd like to test more filters.

## 💼 Why This Project?
This project was developed during my tenure at Škoda, a leading European automotive brand. The data has been carefully altered from the original to ensure compliance with company policies and confidentiality agreements. Nonetheless, the project effectively demonstrates core competencies in Data Analysis.
- Database querying
- Business understanding
- KPI tracking
- Data storytelling
- Visualization & insights communication
